# Notes
* I work with Unity 2019 right now and all the scripts worked fine so far. So, have no idea how it will work with the latest or the oldest versions.
* I added a Blender source file in a case you would like to create your own mapping for whatever platform your want to use it. 

# Plans
* Probably, I will add an Unreal version.
