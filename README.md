# VR Hand Controller
Minimalist Low Poly VR Hand Controllers for your awesome Unity project.

The demo works on the top of XR Interaction Toolkit and XR Emitters (button's animaitions are binded to its events).

# How to use it
* Import `VRHandController.unitypackage` into your project;
* Set up XR Interaction Toolkit and [XR Emitter](https://github.com/Volorf/XR-Emitter);
* Add VR Controller prefab to Hand Controllers and set up it.

# Notes
* I work with Unity 2019 right now and all the scripts worked fine so far. So, have no idea how it will work with the latest or the oldest versions.
* I added a Blender source file in a case you would like to change texture and UV. 

# Plans
* Probably, I will add an Unreal version.
